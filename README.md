# The ____ situation is crazy

Second project I smashed together to learn Next.js, had fun with this, it is a pretty simple app that lets you generate lookalike thumbnails that are seen in penguinz0 videos. This uses the magic of HTML elements to build the thumbnail, and then uses the `html2canvas` library to take a capture of the result.

## Live Demo

## Run locally

1. Clone and run these commands

```cli
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

To build for production, just run `pnpm build` instead.
